  instructions:
    '<ol><li>Using the side of a rolling pin or a meat tenderiser, gently beat the pork until flattened to a 0.5cm thickness.</li><li>Sprinkle the seasoned flour onto a plate. Beat the eggs in a bowl. Mix the breadcrumbs with the grated parmesan and sprinkle the mixture onto another plate.</li><li>Dredge each escalope lightly in the flour on both sides, shaking off any excess, then dip into the egg, then press into the breadcrumb mixture, to coat on both sides. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes before cooking.</li><li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the schnitzels for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown on both sides and completely cooked through (there should be no trace of pink in the middle). Remove from the pan and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.</li><li>For the sauce, pour the wine into a small saucepan, add the tarragon sprig and bring to the boil. Continue to boil for 1-2 minutes, or until the volume of liquid has almost completely reduced.</li><li>Pour in the stock and return the mixture to the boil. Boil for 3-4 minutes, or until reduced in volume by half, then add the cream and simmer for 2-3 minutes until thickened. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then stir in the chopped tarragon.</li><li>To serve, place one pork schnitzel onto each of two plates and spoon over the sauce.

  ],
  instructions:
    'Chop off the stems of the swiss chard at the point where it meets the leaf. You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.\nChop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.\nPlace the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.\nSpiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.\nTo assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.\nEnjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.\nThese wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.',
